# CZ2001-Lab4A

This project is a Java console application developed by shernaliu for CZ2001 Algorithms Lab 4A.

Functionalities:

- Read & initialize a `Graph` from a text file
- Print edges of the graph
- Print node count
- Print edge count
- Print degree of nodes
- Print node count for each k-value
- Check if source node has an edge to destination node
- Output Excel File to visualize data

This project uses the dataset [GR-QC Network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.html).

- 5244 nodes
- 28980 edges
- Conclusion: GR-QC indeed represents a scale-free network.
